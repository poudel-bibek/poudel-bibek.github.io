[{"content":"The meta lessons:\nLearn patterns not problems. Visualize. Visualize. Visualize. Think about how to solve the problem before writing code. Think out loud. Its ok to start with brute force. Never assume. Comparision in Loops. To solve comparision based problems, my first instinct was to always loop through two arrays. However, if a comparision (a,b) is the same as (b,a), a simple trick is to start the second array from current position of the first array i.e., instead of comparing items in the full square shown below, only compare items in the upper triangle. If the comparision between (1, 2) and (2,1) are the same, we can just do (1,2) which is present in the upper triangle.\n1for i in range(len(nums)): 2\tfor j in range(i+1, len(nums)): # This is the upper triangle 3\tprint(nums[i], nums[j]) The advantage of using a while loop over a for loop. 1# I am habituated to think like a for loop, to convert for loop to while loop 2for i in range(k): 3 4# To make this a while loop it requires initialization, update and termination for the loop variable 5i = 0 6while i\u0026lt; k: 7\t# somewhere inside 8\ti+=1 Principle of not materializing unnecessary data structures Or \u0026ldquo;there are ways to know about things without creating the thing\u0026rdquo;. For example:\na. To know the length of the longest sequence, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to create the actual sequence. You can just keep track of the length as you go.\n1# Instead of creating the sequence, keep track of the length as you go 2longest = 0 3for i in range(len(nums)): 4\tlongest = max(longest, nums[i]) b. When dealing with paths in a graph or tree, you might not need to store the entire path, but just keep track of relevant information about it (like its length, start and end points, or some aggregated value).\nThis can lead to more efficient algorithms in terms of both time and space complexity.\nPython related (syntax and more) tricks, which I never bothered to learn until I started solving LeetCode:\nDeletion in lists and dicts 1# delete an item from a list using index 2a = [10, 12, 13, 14, 15] 3del a[3] # deletes the item in index 3 4 5# Interestingly, the same method works to remove an item from dictionary based on key 6mydict = {5: 3, 2: 1, 3: 3, 1: 2} 7del mydict[5] 8print(mydict) 9 10# delete an item from a list using value 11a = [10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15] 12a.remove(10) On Sets. Sets and dictionaries are both implemented using hash tables, this means that they have constant lookup time O(1) i.e., better than a list which is O(n) lookup.\nBefore Python 3.7, sets and dicts were unordered collections i.e., the concept of indexing did not apply. When we print them, they are in random order. Since Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve insertion order (!important). For sets, this is still true. When we print them, they are in random order.\n1# Simple set operations 2lista = [10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 14, 14] 3seen = set() 4for a in lista: 5 if a in seen: 6 print(f\u0026#34;Repeated: {a}\u0026#34;) 7 else: 8 seen.add(a) On Dictionaries. 1# Dict get method with default return values 2chars = \u0026#34;believers\u0026#34; 3mydict= {} 4for char in chars: 5\t# If it finds, it returns the stored value. If not return a 0 6\tmydict[char] = mydict.get(char, 0) + 1 # Genius way to count chars in a string 7print(mydict) Dict keys and values are of type dict_keys and dict_values respectively. We need to convert them to list explicitly. The order of keys and values in dict_keys and dict_values are same as that in the dict (preserves insertion order).\n1mydict = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1} 2print(mydict) 3print(list(mydict.keys())) 4print(list(mydict.values())) On chars and strings. 1# You can also sort characters. In some cases this may be helpful (such as checking equality) 1ord(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;) returns the unicode of the alphabet. then you can do +1 to increment it. 2then you can use chr() to convert it back to the word On Lists and Tuples. Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation) but tuples are immutable. We can perform type conversion with tuple() and list() to convert between them.\n1# Tuples are immutable 2b = tuple([1, 2, 3]) # tuple expects single iterable argument like a list during creation 3b[0] = 10 # This raises TypeError: \u0026#39;tuple\u0026#39; object does not support item assignment 4 5# Lists are mutable 6a = [1, 2, 3] 7a[0] = 10 # This works! Lists can be modified 8print(a) # [10, 2, 3] 9 10# If we do tuple() on a list, it becomes immutable 11a = [1, 2, 3] 12b = tuple(a) 13b[0] = 10 # This is NOT allowed Why do we need a semicolon after break? break; We don\u0026rsquo;t, its optional. Both break and break; work exactly the same way. Additionally, here are some Python tricks I learned from watching Youtube videos from Karpathy (a wizard):\nUsing zip to grab pairs of items. 1ids = [1, 2, 3, 4] 2for item in zip(ids, ids[1:]): 3 print(item) # Gets the pairs (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) 4 # If its changed to ids[2:] we get (1,3), (2,4) 5 6# Utilizing zip to traverse the upper triangle (discussed above). 7nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 8for i in range(1, len(nums)): 9 for item in zip(nums, nums[i:]): 10 print(item) Returning conditions instead of if-else. 1# 1. Instead of using if and else like this: 2if pattern_word == pattern: 3 return True 4else: 5 return False 6 7# 2. Return the condition itself 8return pattern_word == pattern Printing variables with their names. 1# Print a variable with its name 2print(f\u0026#39;{log_likelihood=}\u0026#39;) 3# prints log_likelihood=tensor(-38.7856) Joining a list of strings. 1# Join a list of strings 2words = [\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;World!\u0026#34;] 3 4# Join with empty string 5result1 = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;.join(words) 6print(result1) # HelloWorld! 7 8# Instead of empty string, you can use space, comma, newline etc. 9# Join with space 10result2 = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join(words) 11print(result2) # Hello World! 12 13# Join with newline 14result4 = \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;.join(words) 15print(result4) 16# Hello 17# World!
