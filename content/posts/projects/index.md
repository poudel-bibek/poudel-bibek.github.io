#### DocuMint: Docstring Generation for Python using Small Language Models
[Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10243) | [Code](https://github.com/Docu-Mint/DocuMint) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/documint)  

Benchmarked small language models on their docstring generation quality, created a fine-tuning dataset using the FOSS ecosystem, and fine-tuned Google's CodeGemma. Released the dataset and the fine-tuned model.

-------------------

#### Artificial Intelligence Assignments
[Code](https://github.com/poudel-bibek/AI-Assignments) | [Website](https://poudel-bibek.github.io/AI-Assignments/)  

Developed and delivered programming assignments for graduate level AI and ML courses at University of Memphis. Topics include Deep Q Networks, Proximal Policy Optimization and Finetuning of a Transformer.

-------------------

#### BarterBaron: A commerce app based on barter system trade
[Demo video](https://youtu.be/ME8syiaELWw) | [Code](https://github.com/memphis-cs-projects/comp7012-BarterBaron)  

Developed a ebay-like commerce platform using Ruby on Rails framework with features like chat, content search, and user authentication (won "Best project in the class" award).

-------------------

#### Robustness to Input Corruptions and Adversarial Examples in Steering Angle Prediction via Self-Supervision
[Report](https://poudel-bibek.github.io/pdfs/projects/datamining) | [Video](https://youtu.be/WIzKSNEtSuo) | [Code](https://github.com/poudel-bibek/Contrastive)  

Examined the use of self-supervised learning in steering angle prediction task to enhance model robustness under conditions such as snow, fog, frost, pixelation, and blur.

-------------------

#### Latent Representation of Inputs: A Defense Against Adversarial Examples in DQN
[Report](https://poudel-bibek.github.io/pdfs/projects/defense)  

Used feature squeezing to improve the performance of a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, DQN trained to play Atari Pong, under adversarial attacks.

-------------------

#### Distributed Hyper-paramter tuning of Neural Networks
[Report](/sorry/)  

Parallelized the hyperparameter search objectives in grid search and random search using Distributed Hash Table so that computational resources are shared across multiple nodes to accelerate the search.

-------------------

#### Delta Design 3D Printer
[Report](https://poudel-bibek.github.io/pdfs/reports/3d_delta_printer)  

Designed and developed a working prototype of a 3D printer using Arduino Mega (Senior year Engineering project).
