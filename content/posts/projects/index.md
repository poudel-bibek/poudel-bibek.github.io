#### DocuMint: Docstring Generation for Python using Small Language Models
[thumbnail:documint]
Benchmarked various Small Language Models on their docstring generation quality. Created a fine-tuning dataset and released it along with a fine-tuned Google's CodeGemma model.
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10243) | [Code](https://github.com/Docu-Mint/DocuMint) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/documint)

#### Robustness to Input Corruptions and Adversarial Examples in Steering Angle Prediction via Self-Supervision
[thumbnail:steering-angle]
Used self-supervised learning to enhance robustness of steering angle prediction (using ResNet50 model) under conditions such as snow, fog, frost, pixelation, and blur.

#### Latent Representation of Inputs: A Defense Against Adversarial Examples in DQN
[thumbnail:latent-representation]
Used feature squeezing to improve the performance of a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm (DQN) trained to play Atari Pong, under adversarial attacks.
